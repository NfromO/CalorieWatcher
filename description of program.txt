Calorie watcher app via ms dos. we state the days 
up to 31 and we tell what our calorie limits for 
each day then we apend it to the csv file
(excel file sheet extensions). it states how many 
times we ate per each time calorie lost. no file 
starts at day 1 with random file name, else starts
max day shown + 1.

read the file first and check if day starts at or 1
